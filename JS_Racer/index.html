    <h1>Welcome To The Annual JS Racer 5000!</h1>

    <h2>How You Play!</h2>
    <nav>
    </nav>
     <p>This is a two player game! (You could play by yourself but it's a little sad).
       Player one will control his or her racer with the left key arrow while Player two will control his or her racer with the letter "D" key. Whoever crosses the finish line first, wins! Good luck to all the racers!</p>
