// Functions
// 1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
// - The argument is the input, the parameter is how the input is represented in the function.
// 2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
// We specify the output of a function with the return statement. The return statement is different from console.log() in that we can use the return value of a function to pass as data, whereas we cannot with a console.log().
